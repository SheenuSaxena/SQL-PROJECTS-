My first project that I created on SQL, it involves analyzing music store data, considering various use cases. Some of these use cases include:

1. Finding out which artist has written the most rock music in the dataset.
2. Determining how much each customer spent on the top artists.
3. Identifying the most popular music genre for each country and so on.
